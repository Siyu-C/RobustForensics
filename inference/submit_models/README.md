# Submitted Models

Our models, which were submitted to [Deepfake Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/deepfake-detection-challenge) on Kaggle, can be downloaded at [`submit_models`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1upBl6FzrLko2BfYvqM3cz0zoJfpwjMVg?usp=sharing). By default, to run our inference code, they should be put in this `submit_models` folder.
